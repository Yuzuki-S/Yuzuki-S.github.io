                <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                <p>
                  Mindfulness and self-awareness are very similar. I see mindfulness enables people to perceive their thoughts
                  and emotions. Self-awareness is not only knowing your thoughts and emotions but also seeing the perception of 
                  mindfulness objectively.

                <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan,
                     Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
                <p>
                   I tried journaling. Before I start writing my thoughts on paper, I thought nothing would go through my head and
                   I was sure I would end up writing "nothing to write. What should I write here. Nothing comes to my mind".
                   But when I started, fist thing that came to my mind was how hard JavaScript was! I even felt like I wouldn't make it through this
                   sprint because of how much I struggled. I could not stop what I felt while I was working on this sprint.
                   After the time was up, I felt really good as how I made it after all while I had these negative feelings.
                   I should try this every time when I feel down from now on.

                <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
                <p>
                   I learnt from this section is that our emotions are not who we are. Acknowledging this fact enables us to control
                   our feelings as they just come and go.
