                <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuid?</h4>
                <p>
                    Product was everything for me as I was always dreaming about building cool websites.
                    However after reading process over product, I realised that I am here to learn and to practice the techniques 
                    and skills I have learnt. This was a good wake up call for me as I was just thinking about how I can change my index 
                    page to make it look better and looking for better pictures (again and again)

                    Something that helps to develop emotional intelligence but it is difficult as my thoughts wander constantly.

                <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the new things I have learnt about meditation is mindfulness trains not only paying attention but 
                    also paying attention to attention itself. This made me realise that being distracted during meditation
                    is okay but it is important to realise that I was distracted. Another thing I have learnt that there is no 
                    such thing as bad meditation. Meditation offers an opportunity for growth by overcoming resistance just 
                    like exercise.

                <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                <p>
                    We can practice meditation in any posture we like as long as we remain alarmed and relaxed at the same 
                    time. Our eyes can be either closed, opened, or half-closed as long as it works for us. I used to think
                    we have to do a specific posture with eyes closed to do meditation but it seems that meditation allows
                    us to practce with whatever works/feels comfortable if we can maintain mindfulness.

                <p>
                    "Happiness is the default state of mind. Happiness is not something you pursue; it is something you 
                    allow. Happiness is just being". This way of positive thinking makes people happier.
