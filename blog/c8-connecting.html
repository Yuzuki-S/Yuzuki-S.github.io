                <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
                <p>
                  I have not tried the techniques conciously yet but I believe that 'trust has to begin with sincerity'.
                  I am hoping to build a good relationship with every single person in my kohort so I will assume that everyone is 
                  very nice (I am sure they are) and should be treated kindly.

                <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
                <p>
                 I tried this when my friend was telling me about her struggles. While she was talking, I kept thinking 'if I
                 were her'. When I normally listen to people, I tend to imagine the situation and not what the speaker was feeling 
                 at the time. However, thinking about how the speaker was feeling while listening made me understand the stituation
                 better which I think the speaker wanted me to do.

                <p>
                I always wish everyone to be happy so I did not really feel different by meditating to be honest.
                The only thing I felt differently was that I thought about my parents who live far from me and made
                me feel like I should give them a call after this meditation.

                    I am sure I have disagreed with people and had conficts in the past but I generally do not like 
                    conflicts and I grew up not speaking up when I disagree so I think I tend to forget. 
                    I allowed myself for 20 minutes to think about the difficult situation where I had confilicts with people but 
                    I could not think of anything (yet). However, if I ever have conflict with people I would like to keep in mind that
                    conflict can sometimes arise when both sides are 100% correct and it is important to think from the other person's
                    point of view who you are having a conflict with as this may help me realise that they are also correct.

                <p>
                I enjoyed reading 'How to save marriage and other relationship' exercise which when you have a conflict or fight with
                someone, remind yourself that the person is just like you, wants to be happy just like you and you wish their wellness,
                happiness, freedom from suffering, and so on. I feel this should be everyone's goal and the world will be so peaceful.
