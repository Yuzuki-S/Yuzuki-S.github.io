            Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and express one's own emotions .
            This ability is trainable with practice and this is believed to help people achieve both professional
            and personal success. We can train emotional intelligence by training attention.
            Mindful meditation allow people to pay attention and let them perceive their emotions which will
            also enable them to manage thier emotions.

        <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
        <p>
            It was hard as my mind wanders all the time and I get distracted easily. However if this may 
            help to improve my life and well-being with just two minutes everyday, I would like to 
            train myself to practice this since this is trainable.
