                <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p>
                  I got blocked on the last task of the assignment "Event-driven DOM modification".
                  The assignment was making functions to change the 9 dots (three row of three dots) to blue
                  by clicking the left mouse button on a dot, to green by clicking the right mouse 
                  button, and to disappear by double clicking. I was also required to update the 
                  totals next to the dots, every time dots were clicked.
                  I figured out up to changing the dots but I just could not figure out 
                  how to change the totals. It gave me a hint of using a for loop but I got stuck there
                  for a long time as I had no idea what to do next.

                <h4> What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                <p>
                  I first googled. However, they explained with array, object, etc and I felt like
                  I forgot everything I had learnt already so I studied array and object again.
                  I still could not figure out so I used console.log to print things out. This made me 
                  understand how to refer to each elements in the array. I then could figure out 
                  how to update the totals.

                <p>
                    It is very time consuming but I feel very good after I could work it out. I got very 
                    frustrated while trying to work it out as I was very confused and I felt like I do not
                     understand any of the English words when I was reading stuff on google.

                    While I was googling, I found so many people were questioning the same problem I 
                    got. That made me stop feeling like I was the only one who did not understand.

                <p>
                    I am confident using this as I believe this will help me code efficiently by organising what I have to code.
                    However, as I am not used to doing this I did not try this technique but I will definetely do in the future.

                <p>
                    I love trying something until the problem is solved. When I was working on an assignment, I had no idea how to 
                    code but at first I tried many things just like copy pasting the for loop from google, changing the number in the 
                    array to see what happens, try to remove some sentences to see what happens. This helped me a lot more to understand 
                    some stuff than just reading the concept.

                    I used this technique but it made me frustrated that I know what I need to do on a website visually but I do not know
                    how to code to make it!

                    I am not really confident in reading error messages as I feel like I would not undestand even if I read them.
                    But I guess I should start reading them.

                    I am not shy to ask coaches for help but explaining my problems about coding is NOT EASY.
                    I tend to avoid asking people for help just because I cannot explain my problems properly in writing.

                    Thinking back allows me to reflect on how I solved issues in the past. It gives me confidence that
                    I can continue to move foward when I am stuck.
