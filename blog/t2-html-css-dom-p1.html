        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
        <p>A good analogy for understanding HTML, CSS and the DOM is to think of the different components of being parts of a house. HTML is the structure of a house, describing the layout of the rooms. CSS is the style of the house, specifying the color of the walls, carpets and size and shape of the rooms. The DOM is like an architecture plan which shows each components' details. This will also allow to change the structure and the style of a house.</p>
