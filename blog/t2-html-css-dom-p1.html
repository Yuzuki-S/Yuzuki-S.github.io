                  <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
                  <p>
                      A good analogy for understanding HTML, CSS and the DOM is to think of the different components of being parts of a house.
                      HTML is the structure of a house, describing the layout of the rooms. CSS is the style of the house, specifying the color
                      of the walls, carpets and size and shape of the rooms. The DOM is like an architecture plan which shows each components'
                      details. This will also allow to change the structure and the style of a house.

                  <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
                  <p>
                      Boxifying design is a design technique that devides a website into sections, squares or rectangles, to make it an organised 
                      layout.

                  <img class="boxmodel" src="../Images/box model.gif">
                  <p>
                      The box model boxes every single HTML element on a website into sections. The properties of each box is defined in the CSS 
                      and includes margin, border, padding and content. An example of this can be seen in the image above.
