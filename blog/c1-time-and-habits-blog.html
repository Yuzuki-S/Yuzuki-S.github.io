    My reflection after reading time and habit techniques
  </p>
  <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</th>
        <td>I will use the pomedora technique as I find I have a short attention span. Breaking a big task into small tasks would be great way for me to focus on each task and I believe it will be more efficient to complete a big task.</td>
      </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>What did you find interesting??</th>
          <td>I found the video clip "How to creat a habit: With Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi" interesting. It made me think that keeping the positive mindset attracts a positive life.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>What worked for you?</th>
        <td>Both the pomedora technique and creating good habits will work for my life in many aspects.</td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>Which will you experiment further with?</th>
      <td>I would like to try Headspace to start on a new path to a happier life </td>
  </tr>
