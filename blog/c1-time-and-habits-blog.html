  <h1>Working with Time</h1>
  <p>
    My reflection after reading time and habit techniques
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>

    <p>I will use the pomedora technique as I find I have a short attention span. Breaking a big task into small tasks would be great way for me to focus on each task and I believe it will be more efficient to complete a big task.</p>
    <li>What did you find interesting??</li>
    <p>I found the video clip "How to creat a habit: With Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi" interesting. It made me think that keeping the positive mindset attracts a positive life.
    

    <li>What worked for you?</li>
      <p>Both the pomedora technique and creating good habits will work for my life in many aspects.</p>


    <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
      <p>I would like to try Headspace to start on a new path to a happier life </p>
  </ul>
