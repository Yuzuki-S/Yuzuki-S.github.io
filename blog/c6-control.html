                <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
                <p>
                  My recent triggers are when I run into a problem coding, I google and I cannot find a solution but also google
                  makes me more confused. I then ask people for help and when I don't understand anything they say, I feel like
                  crying and like I haven't learnt anything.

                <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
                <p>
                    I have not been able to try this exercise yet but I will definitely have to try to deal with negative emotions
                    instead of minesweeper, which reduce my stress level a lot. This is a great technique if we could do this 
                    subconciously. This will reduce the times when we regret like "I should not have said that" or 
                    "I should not have reacted that way". I can reflect on my negative thoughts to see if that is helping me to 
                    acheive my goal.
