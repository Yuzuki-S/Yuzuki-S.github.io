                <td>It only works when we have an attitude of trying to make this a fantastic experience. We have a short time frame to learn as much as possible. EDA is all about learning as much as possible while maintaining a positive mindest and learning to work well with others.</td>

                <th>What are your impressions?</th>
                <td>Sherf's explanation about "consumer mindset" made me realise that I have to be really hungry and make the most out of it during this short time period as a customer/consumer. I have made a big investment in this and will only get a lot out of it if I put in the hardwork. </td>

                <th>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</th>
                <td>I love helping others when I am confident in what I know and what I am doing. I am also not afraid of asking questions to others if I am one or one. However, I wish to build my confidence in asking questions in a group through this EDA experience as I think asking questions is the fastest way to learn things. I will enjoy being engaged in this kind of welcoming and learning culture.</td>

                <th>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</th>

                <th>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</th>
