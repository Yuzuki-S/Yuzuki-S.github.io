    <h1>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <p>
      My reflection after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
        <p>It only works when we have an attitude of trying to make this a fantastic experience. We have a short time frame to learn as much as possible. EDA is all about learning as much as possible while maintaining a positive mindest and learning to work well with others.</p>
        <li>What are your impressions?</li>
        <p>Sherf's explanation about "consumer mindset" made me realise that I have to be really hungry and make the most out of it during this short time period as a customer/consumer. I have made a big investment in this and will only get a lot out of it if I put in the hardwork. </p>
        <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
        <p>I love helping others when I am confident in what I know and what I am doing. I am also not afraid of asking questions to others if I am one or one. However, I wish to build my confidence in asking questions in a group through this EDA experience as I think asking questions is the fastest way to learn things. I will enjoy being engaged in this kind of welcoming and learning culture.</p>
        <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
        <p>Yes. In addition to learn coding, I believe I will learn people skills by bulding relationships with others. I will also learn valuable skills to deal with stress and work related situation.</p>
        <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?/li>
        <p>This learning environment is completely new to me so I am excited but nervous at the same time. I look forward to learning a lot and increasing my confidence in many different aspects.</p>
    </ul>
