    <p>
      My reflection after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>

        <li>What are your impressions?</li>

        <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>

        <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>

        <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?/li>
   
    </ul>
