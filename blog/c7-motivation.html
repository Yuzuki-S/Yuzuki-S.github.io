                <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
                <p>
                  Most people tend to try pursue their happiness by the following order, pleasure, passion and purpose.
                  However, the effective strategy is seeking a higher purpose first, and it becomes a passion by working hard to
                  fullfill it and finally it becomes a pleasure by achieving the purpose.
                  This order allows us to have sustainable happiness.

                <h4>- What are your core values?</h4>
                <p>
                  My core values are being humble, being kind to everyone, being happy and always trying to find a way to improve myself.

                <h4>- What do you stand for?</h4>
                <p>
                  I stand for peace.

                <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
                <p>
                  This was hard as I could think of many times when I failed miserably but I could not think of any times when I felt 
                  like I succeeded significantly. Actually I thought about some of my successful experiences, but I tend to compare to the 
                  times I failed. It was not as good as how much I failed. This is because I tend to pay more attention to my failure than
                  my success. However, failure builds success and the resilience ideas fianally reminded me my failures were not only a bad thing
                  as because of my failures, I am who I am and I am very happy now.

                <p>
                This chapter reminded me to believe in myself. I can be who I want to be and trusting myself can help me achieve my goals.
