                <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h4>
                <p>
                    A responsive site is a website that fits the screen size of a user's device. Responsiveness is important as it
                    allows all users to have a good viewing experience accross different types of devices they are using.

                <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile first design is the concept of designing a website based on the size of mobile device screens and 
                    expanding to bigger screen devices. It is important due to the growth of mobile device users and it also 
                    allows designers to focus on the content of the website within limited spaces.

                <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h4>
                <p>
                    Frameworks are pre-designed templates of code (HTML, CSS, JS documents, etc.) which can be used to develop
                    websites. This makes developers' life way easier as this saves them time as they don't have to build a website from scratch.
                    However, this will not only restrict the flexibility of the website but also result in one website resembling
                    another and also limit the developers learning.

                <h4>What a wireframe is and why do we use it?</h4>
                <p>
                    A wireframe is a basic visual structure of a website and provides the information hierarchy of the website
                    and allows for brainstorming ideas amongst teams and clients.

                <h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h4>
                <p>
                    Although I managed to make my websites fairly similar to my wireframes, I needed to change them slightly as
                    there are some sections I did not like once I added the CSS to it.
                    I struggled implementing it since I was confused by when, where and what framework was being used but I hope
                    this will get better with practice (skeleton or my own local css main.css))
