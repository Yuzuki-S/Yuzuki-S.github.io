                <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile first design is the concept of designing a website based on the size of mobile device screen and 
                    expanding to bigger screen devices. It is important due to the growth of mobile device users and it also 
                    allows designers to focus on the content of the website within limited spaces.

                    A good analogy for understanding HTML, CSS and the DOM is to think of the different components of being parts of a house. 
                    HTML is the structure of a house, describing the layout of the rooms. CSS is the style of the house, specifying the color 
                    of the walls, carpets and size and shape of the rooms. The DOM is like an architecture plan which shows each components' 
                    details. This will also allow to change the structure and the style of a house.
