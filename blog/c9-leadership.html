                <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
                <p>
                    I think my most recent manager is a commpassionate leader. When I have a lot of tasks to do at work,
                    she always trusts me that I can do it but also calls me to check to ensure I am okay and reminds me she is happy to 
                    be my first contact if I have any questions or need help. When I struggle with jobs or even my personal life situations, 
                    she always puts herself in my shoes and has compassion for me saying she is thinking of me. This made me feel that when she 
                    asks me for help, I always get really motivated to get the jobs done for her as soon as possible. I believe these leaders 
                    can create a great team.

                <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
                <p>
                    I felt like I became a witch by doing this meditation. I visualised myself sending out all the goodness
                     with white light to everyone. Everyone then becomes really happy and peaceful. I felt good that I made everyone
                     happy (even though it was just imagination)

                <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
                <p>
                    This meditation was harder as this remimded me of when I was suffering which I had forgotten.
                    When I did for other people, this reminded me of people struggling in the world, which I see in everyday's
                    news. I breathed out wishing those people to be happy and wonder what else I can do for them.
                    I am now interested in signing up for red cross after the bootcamp.

                <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Status:</strong> When I compare myself between the present and two months ago, I learnt a lot of skills not only knowing
                    how to code but also how to meditate and believe in myself.<br>
                    <strong>Certainty: </strong> I still feel uncertain about my future as I am changing my career completely but
                    believing that this decision was correct made me get through till the last Sprint!<br>
                    <strong>Autonomy:</strong> I definitely was stressed and helpless about myself during Phrase 0. It is true that
                    what made me down the most was feeling helpless about myself, not stress itself. <br>
                    <strong>Relatedness:</strong> I have been really excited to meet my cohort members. Working on projects together and
                    learning together definitely makes me happier than studying by myself alone.<br>
                    <strong>Fairness:</strong> I have not experienced unfairness during the phrase 0 but I will treat everyone fairly and kindly
                    during the bootcamp.

                <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
                <p>
                    It is always hard to have a difficult conversation as you have to bring out the topic nicely and try not to
                    offend people who you are talking to. Once I have been told that I am not good at having a difficult conversation
                    as I tend not to say anything and accept the difficulty. I figured that it is my weakness so I am hoping that
                    I can train myself and be able to have a difficult conversation with others comfortably to solve problems.

                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>
                    In the book, it talks about how we do not have to have a difficult conversation face to face in the modern world.
                    We have phone, text, email, emoji and so on. Although I understand that miscommunication arises from these methods,
                    it will definitely help me talk more organised, without being too emotional and being straight forward to the point.
