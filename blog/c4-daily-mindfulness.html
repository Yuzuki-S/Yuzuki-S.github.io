                <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
                <p>
                    Mindful conversation is very hard for people who speak English as second language like me.
                    It does not allow me to understand what I think I have heard step by step so when there are some words 
                    I do not understand, I will have to guess what they mean but the speaker would not stop talking to me.
                    It then also requires me to remember what I have heard in English. I may feel the same way with my first language
                    but it would be interesting to try with my first language. However, regardless of the language
                    difficulty, I learnt the importance and power of giving attention to the speakers. For the minutes of listening to 
                    the speaker, nothing else matters but the spearker. This will dramatically help growing and improving the relationship
                    between the speaker and the listener.

                <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
                <p>
                   I like the technique of taking one mindful breath a day. It is very easy and I always believe taking one step
                   at a time ensures I achieve my goals.

                <p>
                    Using babies learning to walk as an example of progress in meditation practice. Babies cannot walk suddenly but 
                    they learn to walk gradually one step to two steps day by day. It then suddenly clicks and they are able to walk.
                    This gives me hope that I can better understand JavaScript as I am very hopeful that one day it will click and I will be able to find it 
                    easy to code.
